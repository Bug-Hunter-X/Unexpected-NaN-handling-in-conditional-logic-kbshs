# Unexpected NaN handling in conditional logic

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to unexpected NaN handling in conditional statements when using loose comparison (==). The issue arises when comparing values with null or NaN using loose equality, which can lead to unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates how to resolve this by using strict equality (===).
